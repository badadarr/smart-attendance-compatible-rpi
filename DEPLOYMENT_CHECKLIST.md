## Operational Checklist

### Daily Operations
- [ ] System health check (`python performance_monitor.py health`)
- [ ] Review attendance data for accuracy
- [ ] Check for any error messages
- [ ] Verify camera functionality
- [ ] Monitor system temperature

### Weekly Maintenance
- [ ] Create system backup (`./backup_restore.sh backup`)
- [ ] Review performance logs
- [ ] Check disk space usage
- [ ] Update attendance statistics
- [ ] Clean camera lens if needed

### Monthly Maintenance
- [ ] System updates (`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`)
- [ ] Performance analysis (`python performance_monitor.py analyze`)
- [ ] Review and clean old log files
- [ ] Check and update training data if needed
- [ ] Verify backup integrity

### Quarterly Maintenance

- [ ] Review user accounts and permissions
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Hardware inspection and cleaning

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### Common Issues
- [ ] Camera not detected → Check connections, enable camera interface
- [ ] Face recognition inaccurate → Retrain with more/better images
- [ ] Web dashboard not accessible → Check Flask service, network settings
- [ ] High system load → Check performance monitor, optimize settings
- [ ] Attendance not recording → Check file permissions, disk space

### Quick Diagnostics
- [ ] Run system check (`python system_check.py`)
- [ ] Check service status (`sudo systemctl status attendance-system`)
- [ ] Review system logs (`journalctl -u attendance-system`)
- [ ] Test camera (`python -c "import cv2; print('Camera OK' if cv2.VideoCapture(0).isOpened() else 'Camera Error')"`)
- [ ] Verify dependencies (`python validate_setup.py --quick`)

### Emergency Procedures
